#CAS Authentication for Outlook Web Access 2010

CasOwa2010 is based on the CasOwa project developed by Bill Thompson (https://github.com/wgthom/CasOwa) 
which is a smaller wrapper around the CAS .NET client. This project only applies the changes needed for OWA 2010
and upgrdes the existing code base to the latest of the dependancies. 

The module also supports Outlook Web Access 2007
